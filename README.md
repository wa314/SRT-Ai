### Abstract
A dataset comprising 160,000 synthetic seismic models that represent conformable and four types of seismic reflection terminations (truncation, toplap, onlap, and downlap) were created and split into two classes (“Contains Termination” and “No Termination”). A new CNN model architecture named “Seismic Reflection Terminations Attribute (SRT-Ai)” was trained on 80% of the synthetic seismic data. SRT-Ai predicted the test set (remaining 20%) with an accuracy and precision of 99.9%. To test its generalization, SRT-Ai was also tested on acquired seismic data. Results showed 91% accuracy and 96% precision. Qualitative analysis of predictions along seismic sections shows a strong correspondence between the model predictions and manual regional interpretations.
SRT-Ai is proposed as a screening tool that will assist seismic interpreters with the identification of major seismic terminations, minimise seismic interpretation uncertainties, reduce the time taken for seismic reconnaissance, and limit the reliance on human visual observation at the early stage of seismic interpretation process.
